\begin{abstract}
  We studied bidirectional program analyses and its precision and soundness, and how information flows represented by bidirectional transfer functions are combined in the program composition such as sequential execution and non-deterministic choice. To analyze program analyses meta-mathematically, we associated representations of information flow through Galois connections. We found that bidirectional information flow has property called butterfly and the property is not preserved by sequential composition in general. Finally, we propose two approaches to properly handle sequential composition in bidirectional analysis.

\section{Introduction}

We investigate data-flow analyses, specifically bidirectional analyses, and their compositionality.
As is standard in data-flow analysis, we work with a domain of data-flow values decribing some aspect of the state of a program's execution at a program point (or possibly different domains for different program points). 
The analysis of an instruction is ideally described by a relation between data-flow values, stipulating which data-flow values at the entry and the exit of the instruction (for short, pre-values and post-values) are considered compatible with each other.
These relations are in practice specified---either specified precisely or approximated soundly---by other means, typically monotone functions in the backward (post-to-pre) or forward (pre-to-post) direction, called transfer functions.
Unidirectional data-flow analyses describe a wide class of aspects of program behavior. But some data-flow analyses are bidirectional, they involve information flow in both directions and are specified by a pair of transfer functions for each instruction. Bidirectional analyses include partial redundancy elimination in the original formulation of Morel and Renvoise \cite{khedker_bidirectional_1999}, type inference for dynamically typed languages \cite{DBLP:journals/cl/KhedkerDM03}, load-pop reduction for stack-machine based languages \cite{frade_bidirectional_2009} and path-sensitive alias analysis \cite{jaiswal_bidirectionality_2020}.

\section{Static analysis}
We model static analyses in the style of \cite{frade_bidirectional_2009}: First we consider
complete lattices whose elements are dataflow values that represent
information on a program point, assign a relation between pre and post
dataflow values for each basic program construct together with reasoning
rules for program compositions such as sequence, choice and loop. We
write $C$, $D$, and $E$ to mean complete lattice of dataflow values, and
represent the type of binary relations on pre and post complete lattices
by subsets of their binary product, e.g, $\Pow(D \times E)$, and write $S$,
$Q$ and $R$ to mean inhabitants of such types. We conventionally refer
to the first component of binary product (i.e, $D$ in $D \times E$) as a
lattice of pre dataflow values, and the second component of binary
product (i.e, $E$ in $D \times E$) as a lattice of post dataflow values.

And then, we approximate such infomation flow presented by a relation to make it computable.
by a bidirectional transfer function pair: one is a monotone function
called backward function which takes a post dataflow value and returns a
pre dataflow value, and another is called forward transfer function
which takes a pre dataflow value and returns a post data value. A type
of bidirectional transfer function pairs are represented by a product of
two spaces of monotone functions, e.g, $((D \tomon E) \times (E \tomon D))$,
and we write $(\fb, \ff)$, $(\gb , \gf)$ for inhabitants of such types.

\section{Galois connections}
A Galois connection between two posets $(X , \leq)$ and $(Y , \leq)$ is a pair
of monotone functions $F : X \tomon Y$ and $G : Y \tomon X$ such that $F(x) \leq y \iff y \leq G(x)$.
In \cite{frade_bidirectional_2009}, a Galois connection between relations and pairs of monotone backward and forward functions was considered.
In this work, we introduce a finer sequence of
Galois connections to facilitate detailed comparison of essential properties
of unidirectional and bidirectional analyses. Fig.~\ref{fig:galois-connections} shows four specification formats of analyses 
flow and Galois connections between them: $\Rel(D, E)= (\Pow(D \times E), \subseteq)$
is the poset of binary relations and the inclusion order, $\Endo(D , E) = (D \times E \tomon D \times E, \leq)$
is the poset of monotone functions on pairs and pointwise order determined
by product order on their codomain. $\Bidir(D , E) = ((E \tomon D) \times (D \tomon E), \leq)$ is the poset of pairs of monotone backward and forward functions and product
order of two pointwise orders; $\Unidir(D , E) = (E \tomon D, \leq)$ is the poset monotone backward functions and pointwise order.

The Galois connections are given by the following monotone functions.
\begin{align*}
  F(R) &= \lambda p_{0}. \bigjoin (p \leq p_{0} \land p \in R) &  G(f) &= \{ p \mid p \leq f(p) \} \\
  H(f) &= (\lambda e. f (\top , e) , \lambda d. f (d , \top)) & I(\fb, \ff) &= \lambda p. (\ff (\pi_{1}(p)) , \fb (\pi_{2}(p))) \\
  J(\fb, \ff) &= \fb & K(\fb) &= (\fb , \lambda d. \top)
\end{align*}

By taking an image of a monotone function with codomain $\Rel(D, E)$,
we obtain a class of relations (a subposet of $\Rel(D, E)$). For
example, $\{ R \in \Rel(D, E) \mid \exists f.\, R = G(f) \}$ can be obtained from $G$
of the topmost Galois connection $F \dashv G$. By general
facts about Galois connections, the obtained image is actually the poset of 
fixed-points of $F \comp G$ and is isomorphic to the poset of
fixed-points of $G \comp F$. In terms of specification of analyses, the image
of $G$ consists of those compatibility relations that can be specified by monotone functions on pairs. This class consists of relations that are closed under arbitary joins (for short, join-closed).
Similarly, the image of $G \comp I$ is the class of relations which are join-closed and also enjoy what we call the butterfly property, and the image of $G \comp I \comp K$ is the class of relations which are join-closed and also pre-down-/post-upclosed. We say that a relation $R$ is \emph{join-closed} if $S \subseteq R \implies \bigjoin S \in R$, \emph{butterfly} if $(d_{0}, e_{1}) \in R \land (d_{1}, e_{0}) \in R \land d_{0} \leq d \leq d_{1} \land e_{0} \leq e \leq e_{1} \implies (d , e) \in R$, and \emph{pre-down-/post-upclosed} if $(d_{1}, e_{0}) \in R \land d \leq d_{1} \land e_{0} \leq e \implies (d , e)$. Fig.~\ref{fig:butterfly} shows diagrammatic presentations of the butterfly and pre-down-/post-upclosed properties.

\section{Compositionality}

Furthermore, we can use the Galois connections to derive composition operators for different analysis specification formats. We focus on sequential composition and nondeterministic choice. In $\Rel(D, E)$,
the analyses of sequential composition and nondeterministic choice of two programs are given by ordinary composition of binary relations ($\bowtie$) and intersection ($\cap$), respectively. One can lift the operations the $\bowtie$ and $\cap$
into operations on another poset along a Galois connection: in particular for the Galois connection $F \dashv G$, we get operations $f \bowtielift g = F (G(f) \bowtie G(g))$ and $f \caplift g = F(G (f) \cap G(g))$ on $\Endo(D,E)$.
From general facts about Galois connections, the inequations
$G(f) \bowtie G(g) \subseteq G (f \bowtielift g)$ and $G(f) \cap G(g)) \subseteq G(f \caplift g)$ hold for any $f$ and $g$.
This fact ensures that the lifted composition operations are complete wrt.\ their ideal counterpart in $\Rel(D, E)$ (overapproximate them), but does not guarantee their soundness (underapproximation, which is what we really need).
By expanding out the individual definitions of the Galois connections leading to $\Rel(D ,E)$ ($F \dashv G$ , $H \comp F \dashv G \comp I$, and $J \comp H \comp F \dashv G \comp I \comp K$, specifically) and calculating specifically for each case, we can confirm that all the lifted operations are indeed sound too, except for the lifted sequential composition operator for $\Bidir(D, E)$, namely, $(\fb , \ff) \bowtielift (\gb , \gf) = H(F((G(I(\fb , \ff)) \bowtie G(I(\gb , \gf)))))$. This phenomenon occurs because the butterfly property is not closed under relation composition.

In terms of analyses, this means that the sequential composition of two compatibility relations, each of them described by a bidirectional transfer function pair, cannot be safely represented by a single bidirectional transfer function pair. This phenomenon does not occur in unidirectional analyses, but only in bidirectional analyses. 

In this work, we present two different technical approaches to address this phenomenon.

One approach is to use the fact that soundness of lifted operations still holds for the Galois connection between $n$-ary relations $\Pow(D_{1}, D_{2}, ... , D_{n})$ and $n-1$ pairs of monotone functions $((D_{1} \tomon D_{2}) \times (D_{2} \tomon D_{1}) \times ... \times (D_{n-1} \tomon D_{n}) \times (D_{n} \tomon D_{n-1}))$. In this approach, compositionality is somewhat broken in that intermediate program points cannot be hidden in sequential composition. 

Another approach is to restrict the class of relations to a class narrower than the class of join-closed butterfly relations but closed under relation composition and intersection. We show that the poset $\UnidirConst(D, E) = ((E \tomon D) \times E, \leq)$ (with forward functions constant) locates between $\Unidir(D , E)$ and $\Bidir(D, E)$, the class of relations corresponding to $\UnidirConst(D, E)$ is  closed under both $\bowtie$ and $\cap$, and the lifted operations are sound.
This approach does not always allow one to capture the original bidirectional analysis exactly. For example, in the load-pop reduction analysis, the compatibility relations for all single instructions are butterfly, but those for some sequences are not. Still, it can provide a reasonable systematic overapproximation in some cases.
